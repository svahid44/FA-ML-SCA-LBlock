# Stage 08 — Large attack-oriented campaign

**Phase:** B  
**Canonical source run:** `stage08_20260718_182609_471595_seed20260718`

## Objective

Generate the multi-key, multi-session campaign for ML and attack evaluation.

## Directory contents

- `code/`: canonical implementation.
- `artifacts/`: compact public contracts, configurations, figures, tables, and freeze records.
- `PROVENANCE.json`: source run ID and SHA-256 provenance.

## Data boundary

Large traces, full campaigns, serialized models, and private truth are not
stored in Git. See [`../../../data/DATA_ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.csv`](../../../data/DATA_ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.csv).

## Execution note

Run from the repository root. Stages 13–15 are Jupyter/VS Code cell exports and
reuse the validated Stage-12 kernel context used by the official experiment.
